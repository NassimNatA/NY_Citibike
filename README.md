# NY Citibike Analysis 

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to support the proposal of a bike-sharing investment to stakeholders based on in-depth analysis that will demonstrate the following: 
- Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
From these characteristics of the business, it will be determined if trends are evident that support the investment of the bike-sharing program. In order to conduct this research, tableau will be used for data visualizations and to explore program trends. 

## Results: Tableau Visualziations and Descriptions
- Checkout Time for Users (Trip Duration)

Visualization of trip duration demonstrates that bike trips are significantly long with durations of 4-6 hours most frequent and highest frequency of 5 hours long. 

- Checkout Times by Gender

When separating by gender, there are much higher number of bikesfor males (medium blue in image) compared to females. In addition, both genders show a peak of bike trips that extend 4-6 hours as exemplified by the previous image. 

- Trip by Weekday per Hours

A heat map generated for the bike trips by Weekday and per hour demonstrate that bikes are used most prominently on weekends, and on weekdays for commuting in the AM (to work: 6 AM - 9AM, from work: 5 PM - 6P M). 

- Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

A heat map of trip by gender show males are consistently with a higher number of records (i.e number of rides), but that females share the similar pattern of using bikes for commute during the AM (7 AM -9 AM) and PM (4 PM - 6 PM). 

-User Trips by Gender by Weekday

A heat map of the trips by gender by weekday demonstrate that a majority of subscribers identify as male. This is anticipated since males have been shown in previous visualizations above to be the primary customer for bikeshares with the highest numer of bike rides acroos weekends, weekdays, and trip duration. 



## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
