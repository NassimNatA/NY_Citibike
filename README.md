# NY Citibike Analysis 

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to support the proposal of a bike-sharing investment to stakeholders based on in-depth analysis that will demonstrate the following: 
- Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
From these characteristics of the business, it will be determined if trends are evident that support the investment of the bike-sharing program.
